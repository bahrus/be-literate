Enhance the input element so it can declaratively read contents from a local file (or files).

be-literate turns this [code snippet](https://www.w3docs.com/learn-javascript/file-and-filereader.html) into an attribute-based HTML Enhancement / Decorator / Behavior / Directive / Custom Attribute.

Syntax:

```html
<input type=file be-literate onload="
    const {fileContents} = event;
    console.log({fileContents});
" onprogress="console.log(event)">
```

It causes the input element to emit event "load", and the contents are provided in the event's fileContents.  In case other fellow enhancements are "overloading" the onload event in this way, check that the event's "enh" value is set to the name of the enhancement within the Shadow Realm ('beLiterate' or 'ðŸ“–', for example) before proceeding.

## Security [TODO]

Unfortunately, the platform provides no support for being able to confirm the integrity of the markup shown above.

So in fact when you run the code above  

In a closed environment, where the chances of clashes with other custom attributes can be controlled, consider using a smaller name, like ðŸ“–, by referencing an [alternate EMC file](https://github.com/bahrus/be-literate/blob/baseline/%F0%9F%93%96.js):

```html
<input type=file ðŸ“– onload="
    const {fileContents} = event;
    console.log({fileContents});
">
```

(On Windows, for the ðŸ“– emoji, type ðŸªŸ + . + open book, and it will remain in recent memory).

The file contents can be read via path: inputEl.beEnhanced.beLiterate.fileContents (or inputEl.beEnhanced.ðŸ“–.fileContents).

## Specifying Read Option

To specify which of the file read options to apply to the file(s), set the attribute:

```html
<input type=file ðŸ“–='{"readVerb": "readAsDataURL"}' >
```

If not specified, as above, the default is readAsText.
